This repository is for the paper titled "Robust Subgraph Learning by Monitoring Early Training Representations" by Sepideh Neshatfar and Salimeh Yasaei Sekeh, published in IEEE IDS 2025.

## Shells to Run
### Train
In order to find the subgraph indices for a specific dataset run the "Job.sh" shell available in the train folder. 
### Evaluate
To evaluate the indices of the resulting subgraph for different compression ratios, and Robustness-Performance combinations, run the "Job_Eval.sh" shell available in the Evaluate folder.
